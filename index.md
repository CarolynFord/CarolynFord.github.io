I've worked at Western International, a unit dedicated to executing Western University's international strategy, since November 2011. 

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Use of operations research and management science methods in support of marketing and recruitment of international students.
- The extent to which queuing theory and simulation models are relevant to university operations.
